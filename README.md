program for slicing
Python List Slicing Demonstration
This program explains how list slicing works in Python, demonstrating the use of positive and negative indices with a step.

l1[5:11:1] extracts elements starting from index 5 up to the end of the list (indices 5-9), resulting in [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

l1[-1:-6:-1] extracts elements in reverse order, starting from the last element (index -1) back to index -5, yielding [10, 9, 8, 7, 6].
Python dictionary demonstration
in program second there is dict of student alice in which if and else condition is used to check if alice's name is correctly given by user or not if not given then else condition is executed and user will get a message which states student is not in dict
