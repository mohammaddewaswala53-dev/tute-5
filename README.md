Python List Slicing Demonstration
This program explains how list slicing works in Python, demonstrating the use of positive and negative indices with a step.

l1[5:11:1] extracts elements starting from index 5 up to the end of the list (indices 5-9), resulting in [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

l1[-1:-6:-1] extracts elements in reverse order, starting from the last element (index -1) back to index -5, yielding [10, 9, 8, 7, 6].
